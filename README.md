# Hi, I'm Naomi! ðŸ’¬â˜• 
I love to code and learn what I do not yet know. I currently study fulltime as a Game Programming student at Forsbergs. The big dream is to become an Indie Developer and make it in the big wide world, creating games and experiences for people.

### What I'm Currently Developing:
* **School Project** - A simple 2.5D Jam-Style Platformer made with a team where I'm implementing flight mechanics. [Repository](https://github.com/forsbergsskola-se/gp21-22-0126-unity-game-mechanics-team-5-1).
* **Side Project** - A Unity Snake game. Using C# for the mechanics as well as my own art for the graphics. [Link Coming...]()
